  - Created Sign In, Sign Up, and user profile components.
  - Added email/password and magic link authentication methods.
- **Migrated Auth Helpers:**
  - Encountered persistent cookie issues with `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` in the Next.js App Router context (Middleware/Route Handlers).
  - Migrated from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to the recommended `@supabase/ssr` library.
  - Updated client creation (`createBrowserClient`, `createServerClient`) and middleware/route handler logic according to `@supabase/ssr` patterns.
- **Extensive Debugging:**
  - Iteratively debugged cookie setting/reading issues between Route Handlers and Middleware.
  - Added and removed detailed logging across multiple components.
  - Explored various cookie setting strategies (automatic, manual, header append).
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Resolved installation issues with `@supabase/ssr` via clean installs (`npm install`).
  - Generated Supabase types using the CLI (`supabase gen types`).
- **Cleanup:**
  - Removed excessive debugging logs.
  - Uninstalled unused dependencies (`@types/cookie`).
  - Added documentation comments to relevant auth files.

## 2024-05-06: Testing Framework Setup and Initial Tests 🧪

### Changes Made

- **Frontend Testing (Vitest):**
  - Integrated Vitest, React Testing Library, and related dependencies.
  - Configured Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`) including path alias resolution and `.env.local` loading via `dotenv`.
  - Added test setup file (`src/test/setup.ts`) for global configurations (e.g., jest-dom matchers).
  - Added `test` and `coverage` scripts to `package.json` (`vitest run`).
  - Resolved issues preventing `npm test` execution (corrupted `package.json` parsing).
  - Implemented initial component tests for `Navigation.tsx` (`components/Navigation.test.tsx`).
  - Included mocking for `next/navigation` (`usePathname`), custom hooks (`useAuth`), and external dependencies (`supabaseClient`).
  - Resolved TypeScript (`tsc`) errors related to Vitest globals and mock types.
  - Updated frontend CI (`frontend.yml`) to inject Supabase environment variables during `next build` using GitHub secrets and environments.

- **Backend Testing (Pytest):**
  - Set up `tests` directory structure.
  - Resolved initial Mypy configuration issues ("Source file found twice"); subsequently removed Mypy from CI workflow (`backend.yml`) due to type errors in dependencies.
  - Implemented initial tests for Pydantic schemas (`tests/test_schemas.py`) covering validation and defaults.
  - Implemented initial tests for `EmbeddingService` (`tests/test_embedding_service.py`), including mocking `SentenceTransformer` using `unittest.mock.patch`.
  - Resolved test failures related to mock scope/timing.
  - Fixed various Ruff linting errors in test files (E501, N803, E402, E712) and silenced PLR2004 (magic numbers) warnings with `noqa` comments.

### Benefits

- ✅ Basic testing infrastructure established for both frontend and backend.
- ✅ CI workflows updated to handle build requirements and run basic checks.
- ✅ Examples of component testing, mocking, and schema validation.
- ✅ Improved code quality through linting fixes in tests.

### Next Steps

1. Expand test coverage for both frontend and backend components/services.
2. Re-evaluate adding Mypy back to backend CI once underlying type issues are addressed.
3. Implement remaining TODOs in existing test files (e.g., `Navigation.test.tsx`).
4. Continue feature development (profile management, RLS, etc.).

## 2024-05-07: CI Pipeline Refinements and Backend Test Expansion 🛠️

### Changes Made

- **Backend Test Expansion:**
  - Added tests for `AlertCreate` and `AlertUpdate` Pydantic schemas (`tests/test_schemas.py`).
  - Added tests for `EmbeddingService` (`tests/test_embedding_service.py`), including mocking the `SentenceTransformer` model using `unittest.mock.patch`.
  - Refined mocking strategy in `test_embedding_service.py` to correctly handle fixture scope vs. patch scope.
  - Fixed Ruff linting errors (E501, N803, E402, E712) and silenced PLR2004 warnings in test files.
- **CI Pipeline Fixes:**
  - Configured Codecov action (`backend.yml`) to use `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret, resolving tokenless upload errors.
  - Confirmed frontend build step (`frontend.yml`) includes necessary Supabase environment variables via GitHub secrets/environments.
  - Ensured backend `pytest` runs successfully after test additions and fixes.

### Benefits

- ✅ Increased backend test coverage (schemas, embedding service).
