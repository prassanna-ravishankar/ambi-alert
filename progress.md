## 2024-03-20: Task Updates and Monitoring Control 🎮

### Changes Made

- 🔄 Added option to disable monitoring in example.py
- 🤔 Analyzed query expander placement:
  - Decision: Query expander should remain in initial setup (not monitor/alerter) because:
    1. Expansion is needed when setting up monitoring targets
    2. Monitor should focus on checking existing URLs
    3. Alerter should focus on notification delivery
