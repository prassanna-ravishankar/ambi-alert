# AmbiAlert

AmbiAlert is a powerful web monitoring tool that helps you stay informed about topics that matter to you. Instead of constantly checking websites for updates, AmbiAlert does the work for you by monitoring relevant web pages and alerting you when meaningful changes occur.

## Features

- üîç Smart query expansion: Automatically expands your search queries to cover different aspects of your topic
- üåê Intelligent web monitoring: Tracks relevant websites and detects meaningful changes
- ü§ñ AI-powered relevance checking: Uses advanced language models to ensure changes are actually relevant to your interests
- üìß Flexible alerting system: Supports email notifications (with more backends coming soon)
- üíæ Persistent monitoring: Uses SQLite to track monitored URLs and their states
- üîÑ Automatic retries: Handles temporary failures gracefully

## Installation

```bash
pip install ambi-alert
```

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use AmbiAlert is through its command-line interface:

```bash
# Monitor news about the next iPhone (prints alerts to console)
ambi-alert "next iPhone release"

# Monitor with email alerts
ambi-alert "next iPhone release" \
    --smtp-server smtp.gmail.com \
    --smtp-port 587 \
    --smtp-username your.email@gmail.com \
    --smtp-password "your-app-password" \
    --from-email your.email@gmail.com \
    --to-email target.email@example.com

# Check more frequently (every 15 minutes)
ambi-alert "next iPhone release" --check-interval 900
```

## Python API

You can also use AmbiAlert programmatically:

```python
from ambi_alert import AmbiAlert
from ambi_alert.alerting import EmailAlertBackend

# Create an alert backend (optional)
alert_backend = EmailAlertBackend(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    username="your.email@gmail.com",
    password="your-app-password",
    from_email="your.email@gmail.com",
    to_email="target.email@example.com"
)

# Create AmbiAlert instance
ambi = AmbiAlert(alert_backend=alert_backend)

# Add queries to monitor
ambi.add_monitoring_query("next iPhone release")
ambi.add_monitoring_query("AI breakthrough")

# Start monitoring
ambi.run_monitor()
```

## How It Works

1. When you add a query, AmbiAlert:

   - Expands your query to cover different aspects of the topic
   - Searches the web using DuckDuckGo to find relevant pages
   - Stores the URLs and their current content state in a database

2. While monitoring, AmbiAlert:
   - Periodically checks each monitored URL for changes
   - Uses AI to determine if changes are relevant to your query
   - Generates a human-readable summary of relevant changes
   - Sends alerts through configured backends
