# üõ∞Ô∏è Project: Ambient Alert System (Codename: AmbiAlert)

## üåü Overview

**AmbiAlert** is a natural language-powered alerting service that monitors websites and content sources for meaningful changes. Users define alerts in plain English, and the system watches for changes using LLM-based query parsing and embedding-based change detection.

---

## üéØ Core Features

- Accept user queries like "Tell me when OpenAI updates their research page"
- Use Perplexity API to identify authoritative sources to monitor
- Parse intent into structured metadata using an LLM
- Monitor the target (webpage, RSS feed, YouTube) for updates
- Use **semantic embeddings** to detect meaningful changes
- Notify users via email when relevant updates are detected

---

## üß© System Components

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)

- User input for alert text and email
- Source discovery interface with Perplexity integration
- Source selection and management dashboard
- Change visualization and history
- Source reliability metrics display

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)

- POST /alert ‚Äî Create a new alert with source discovery
- GET /alerts ‚Äî Retrieve active alerts
- DELETE /alert/{id} ‚Äî Remove an alert
- POST /check-updates ‚Äî Trigger all alert checks
- POST /sources/discover ‚Äî Discover new sources
- POST /sources/re-evaluate ‚Äî Re-evaluate existing sources
- Auth endpoints (handled by Supabase):
  - POST /auth/signup
  - POST /auth/login
  - POST /auth/logout
  - GET /auth/user

### 3. Source Discovery Service

- Powered by Perplexity API
- Identifies authoritative sources
- Provides source metadata:
  - Reliability score
  - Update frequency
  - Content relevance
  - Source type (website, RSS, YouTube)
- Supports periodic re-evaluation

### 4. Monitoring Engine

- Supports:
  - ‚úÖ Static webpages (Playwright or BeautifulSoup)
  - ‚úÖ YouTube channels (YouTube API)
  - ‚úÖ RSS feeds
- Extracts readable text content
- Embeds using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Compares new embedding with previous using cosine similarity
- Tracks changes relative to original query

### 5. Change Detection

- Uses vector-based semantic diffing
- Alerts user if similarity drops below threshold (e.g., 0.9)
- Optionally include keyword filter to improve precision
- Provides change context and relevance
- Maintains change history

### 6. Notification Service

- Sends email alerts with detected changes
- Includes source reliability context
- Future: Slack, Discord, Webhooks, mobile push

## üíæ Data Storage

### Supabase Integration

- PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- Tables:
  - `alerts`: stores alert metadata
  - `sources`: stores discovered sources and metadata
  - `changes`: stores content change history
  - `embeddings`: stores content embeddings using pgvector
  - `profiles`: stores user profile data
- Authentication:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Magic link authentication
  - OAuth providers (GitHub, Google)
- Real-time subscriptions for updates
- Row Level Security for data protection
- Built-in authentication and authorization

### Features

- Vector similarity search using pgvector
- Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
- Automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
- Database migrations and versioning
- Connection pooling and query optimization
